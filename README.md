# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

# What technologies we used:

Express : Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.

NodeJs : Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.

Mongoose : Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports Node.js and Deno (alpha).

REST API : A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.

Postman : Postman is an API Platform for developers to design, build, test and iterate their APIs.
ESLint : ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.
